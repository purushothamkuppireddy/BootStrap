                    <p>On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate
                        with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to
                        insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document
                        building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also
                        coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting
                        of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the selected
                        text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format
                        text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most controls
                        offer a choice of using the look from the current theme or using a format
                        that you specify directly. To change the overall look of your document,
                        choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change the looks available
                        in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command.
                        Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands
                        so that you can always restore the look of your document to the original
                        contained in your current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries include
                        items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document.</p>
