            <p>On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate
                with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to
                insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document
                building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also
                coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting
                of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the selected
                text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format
                text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab.</p>
